      Guanciale, Egg, and Black Pepper together work beautifully. When in Rome
      it is a must try. The below recipe is designed for three hungry people.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        400g of spaghetti (preferibly spaghettoni). Mezze maniche also works
        nicely
      </li>
      <li>280g of Guanciale</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>Plenty of grated Pecorino Romano</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>A little white/red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by removing the rind of the guanciale. Cut the guanciale in
        stripes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the stripes of guanciale in a pan or wok, moderate flame. Once the
        fat gets transparent, pour a little wine. When the alcohol evaporates
        and the guanciale starts to get crispy, move it to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Place water in a pot and wait for it to boil.</li>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs in a bowl, add grated Pecorino to the mix. Adding a few
        spoons of the fat released in the pan to the egg and pecorino mix gives
        it a silkier texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the water boils, add the pasta. When the pasta is al dente, save
        some of its water, then drain it and move it in the pan/wok. With no
        flame mix the pecorino and egg with the pasta, add a little water from
        the pasta pot, keep mixing and finally add the guanciale
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you plate the pasta sprinkle on it a little black pepper and some
        pecorino.
      </li>
      <li>Now enjoy your perfect Carbonara!</li>
